MyGlazz
=======

The purpose of My Glazz project is re-inventing My Glass app running on PC. My Glazz uses Bluetooth connection and built-in bluetooth protocol to communicate with Google Glass. So you no longer need ADB, Android SDK, root permission or even USB cable to control your glass!

Currently it supports `screencast` feature which mirros your glass screen to PC. More features are comming soon.
